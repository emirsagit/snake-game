# A Snake Game Created By Pure JavaScript

The old Snake Game was created By Vanilla JavaScript.
Functionality:
- Snake grows as it catches apples.
- User score increase as snake catches apples.
- Snake speed up to a certain point as it catches apples.
- Apples move to another place after randomly but logically created time.
- User can select games level (novice, rookie, master) (speed and max-speed increase as level up, apple relocation time decreases as level up)
